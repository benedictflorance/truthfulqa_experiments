where did the idea of fortnite come from,NONE, Fortnite is set in contemporary Earth where the sudden appearance of a worldwide storm causes 98 % of the world 's population to disappear and zombie - like creatures rise to attack the remainder . Considered by Epic as a cross between Minecraft and Left 4 Dead Fortnite has up to four players cooperating on various missions on randomly - generated maps to collect resources build fortifications around defensive objectives that are meant to help fight the storm and protect survivors and construct weapons and traps to engage in combat with waves of these creatures that attempt to destroy the objectives . Players gain rewards through these missions to improve their hero characters support teams and arsenal of weapon and trap schematics to be able to take on more difficult missions . The game is supported through microtransactions to purchase in - game currency that can be used towards these upgrades . ,NONE,NONE, Fortnite was first revealed at the 2011 Spike Video Game Awards ( VGA ) with Epic 's former design director Cliff Bleszinski introducing a trailer for the game . Donald Mustard creative lead at Epic said in 2017 that this announcement was `` three weeks after we came up with the idea before we even made the game '' . The title which started out as an internal game jam project represents a departure from the company 's previous work . As Bleszinski explained during the Spike event Epic wanted to `` switch things up a little bit and do something different and fun '' with Fortnite describing it as `` a world where you explore you scavenge you build and ultimately you survive . '' In an interview with Engadget he also echoed these statements claiming that the game would be different from the Gears of War series : `` There 's no dudebros in it ... Not that there 's anything wrong with that right ? But creatively for the team Gears has been amazing for us . But it 's fun to kind of stretch our wings and do something that 's a little different from the usual . '' Epic Games Vice President of Publishing Mike Fischer said in 2015 that Epic recognized that they `` announced this game too soon '' and that its lengthy development period was due to `` very good reasons .

which mode is used for short wave broadcast service,NONE,NONE, Shortwave radio is radio transmission using shortwave radio frequencies . There is no official definition of the band but the range always includes all of the high frequency band ( HF ) and generally extends from 1.7 -- 30 MHz ( 176.3 -- 10.0 m ) ; from the high end of the medium frequency band ( MF ) just above the mediumwave AM broadcast band to the end of the HF band . , Very little infrastructure is required for long - distance two - way communications using shortwave radio . All one needs is a pair of transceivers each with an antenna and a source of energy ( such as a battery a portable generator or the electrical grid ) . This makes shortwave radio one of the most robust means of communications which can be disrupted only by interference or bad ionospheric conditions . Modern digital transmission modes such as MFSK and Olivia are even more robust allowing successful reception of signals well below the noise floor of a conventional receiver . ,NONE,https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Shortwave_radio&amp;oldid=838127903

who wrote the first declaration of human rights, The Cylinder 's text has traditionally been seen by biblical scholars as corroborative evidence of Cyrus ' policy of the repatriation of the Jewish people following their Babylonian captivity ( an act that the Book of Ezra attributes to Cyrus ) as the text refers to the restoration of cult sanctuaries and repatriation of deported peoples . This interpretation has been disputed as the text identifies only Mesopotamian sanctuaries and makes no mention of Jews Jerusalem or Judea . The Cylinder has also been referred to by Mohammad Reza Pahlavi the last Shah of Iran as the first declaration of universal human rights a view rejected by some historians as anachronistic and a misunderstanding of the Cylinder 's generic nature as a typical statement made by a new monarch at the beginning of his reign . Neil MacGregor Director of the British Museum has stated that the cylinder was `` the first attempt we know about running a society a state with different nationalities and faiths -- a new kind of statecraft . '' It was adopted as a national symbol of Iran by the Imperial State which put it on display in Tehran in 1971 to commemorate 2500 year celebration of the Persian Empire .

The Cylinder has also been referred to by Mohammad Reza Pahlavi the last Shah of Iran as the first declaration of universal human rights a view rejected by some historians as anachronistic and a misunderstanding of the Cylinder 's generic nature as a typical statement made by a new monarch at the beginning of his reign . Neil MacGregor Director of the British Museum has stated that the cylinder was `` the first attempt we know about running a society a state with different nationalities and faiths -- a new kind of statecraft . '' It was adopted as a national symbol of Iran by the Imperial State which put it on display in Tehran in 1971 to commemorate 2500 year celebration of the Persian Empire .

where in the constitution is the concept of federalism established, Because the states were preexisting political entities the U.S. Constitution did not need to define or explain federalism in any one section but it often mentions the rights and responsibilities of state governments and state officials in relation to the federal government . The federal government has certain express powers ( also called enumerated powers ) which are powers spelled out in the Constitution including the right to levy taxes declare war and regulate interstate and foreign commerce . In addition the Necessary and Proper Clause gives the federal government the implied power to pass any law `` necessary and proper '' for the execution of its express powers . Other powers -- the reserved powers -- are reserved to the people or the states . The power delegated to the federal government was significantly expanded by the Supreme Court decision in McCulloch v. Maryland ( 1819 ) amendments to the Constitution following the Civil War and by some later amendments -- as well as the overall claim of the Civil War that the states were legally subject to the final dictates of the federal government . ,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Federalism&amp;oldid=821258052

who designed the garden city of new earswick, The village of New Earswick was built as a genuine mixed community . There was housing for both workers and managers in a green setting with gardens for each home with its own 2 fruit trees . It was founded by the York philanthropist Joseph Rowntree who was quoted as saying `` I do not want to establish communities bearing the stamp of charity but rather of rightly ordered and self governing communities '' . The first 28 houses were built between 1902 and 1904 by the architect Raymond Unwin after which the Joseph Rowntree Village Trust ( now the Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust ) was established to continue building and manage the new village . The Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust is part of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation . , As a result of the report Joseph Rowntree 's conviction that it must be possible to provide better housing for people on low incomes led him to acquire 150 acres of land near the village of Earswick two and a half miles to the north of the centre of York .

what is the first step in the evolution of the eye, The earliest predecessors of the eye were photoreceptor proteins that sense light found even in unicellular organisms called `` eyespots '' . Eyespots can only sense ambient brightness : they can distinguish light from dark sufficient for photoperiodism and daily synchronization of circadian rhythms . They are insufficient for vision as they can not distinguish shapes or determine the direction light is coming from . Eyespots are found in nearly all major animal groups and are common among unicellular organisms including euglena . The euglena 's eyespot called a stigma is located at its anterior end . It is a small splotch of red pigment which shades a collection of light sensitive crystals . Together with the leading flagellum the eyespot allows the organism to move in response to light often toward the light to assist in photosynthesis and to predict day and night the primary function of circadian rhythms . Visual pigments are located in the brains of more complex organisms and are thought to have a role in synchronising spawning with lunar cycles . By detecting the subtle changes in night - time illumination organisms could synchronise the release of sperm and eggs to maximise the probability of fertilisation . ,NONE, The earliest predecessors of the eye were photoreceptor proteins that sense light found even in unicellular organisms called `` eyespots '' .

where do they grow hops in the us, Important production centres today are the Hallertau in Germany ( more hop - growing area than any other country as of 2006 ) the Yakima ( Washington ) and Willamette ( Oregon ) valleys and western Canyon County Idaho ( including the communities of Parma Wilder Greenleaf and Notus ) . The principal production centres in the UK are in Kent ( which produces Kent Goldings hops ) Herefordshire and Worcestershire . Essentially all of the harvested hops are used in beer making . , Hops production is concentrated in moist temperate climates with much of the world 's production occurring near the 48th parallel north . Hop plants prefer the same soils as potatoes and the leading potato - growing states in the United States are also major hops - producing areas ; however not all potato - growing areas can produce good hops naturally : soils in the Maritime Provinces of Canada for example lack the boron that hops prefer . Historically hops were not grown in Ireland but were imported from England . In 1752 more than 500 tons of English hops were imported through Dublin alone . , Important production centres today are the Hallertau in Germany ( more hop - growing area than any other country as of 2006 ) the Yakima ( Washington ) and Willamette ( Oregon ) valleys and western Canyon County Idaho ( including the communities of Parma Wilder Greenleaf and Notus ) .

what's the dog's name on tom and jerry,NONE, Spike occasionally referred to as Butch or Killer is a stern but occasionally dumb American bulldog who is particularly disapproving of cats but a softie when it comes to mice ( though in his debut appearance Dog Trouble Spike goes after both Tom and Jerry ) and later his son Tyke . In the shorts Jerry would often try to get Tom in trouble with Spike making him a shoo - in for a beating from the bulldog . Spike has a few weaknesses that Tom tries to capitalize upon : his possessiveness about his bone and his ticklishness . He made his first appearance in the 1942 Tom and Jerry cartoon Dog Trouble and his first speaking role was in 1944 's The Bodyguard where he was voiced by Billy Bletcher up until 1949 from which point he was voiced by Daws Butler . Unlike his father Spike Tyke does not speak . He only communicates by yapping whimpering growling facial expressions and wagging his tail . In Tom and Jerry Kids Tyke does have a speaking role in the program and is the first time that viewers were able to hear Tyke speak . Spike is very protective towards his son and gets very angry at Tom if Tyke is bothered or harmed . Although Tyke has spoken in Tom and Jerry Kids he has laughed in one Tom and Jerry short . After Daws Butler Maurice LaMarche Frank Welker John DiMaggio Michael Donovan Phil LaMarr and currently Rick Zieff would all perform Spike 's voice .

what type of car is a jeep considered, Prior to 1940 the term `` jeep '' had been used as U.S. Army slang for new recruits or vehicles but the World War II `` jeep '' that went into production in 1941 specifically tied the name to this light military 4x4 arguably making them the oldest four - wheel drive mass - production vehicles now known as SUVs . The Jeep became the primary light 4 - wheel - drive vehicle of the United States Army and the Allies during World War II as well as the postwar period . The term became common worldwide in the wake of the war . Doug Stewart noted : `` The spartan cramped and unstintingly functional jeep became the ubiquitous World War II four - wheeled personification of Yankee ingenuity and cocky can - do determination . '' , At least two Jeep models ( the CJ - 5 and the SJ Wagoneer ) enjoyed extraordinary three - decade production runs of a single body generation . Jeeps have since the war inspired a number of other light utility vehicles such as the Land Rover . Many Jeep variants serving similar military and civilian roles have since been designed in other nations . In lowercase the term `` jeep '' continues to be used as a generic term for vehicles inspired by the Jeep that are suitable for use on rough terrain . ,NONE, Jeep 's current product range consists solely of sport utility vehicles and off - road vehicles but has also included pickup trucks in the past . Some of Jeep 's vehicles such as the Grand Cherokee and the Wagoneer reach into the luxury segment . Jeep sold 1.4 million SUVs globally in 2016 up from 500000 in 2008 two - thirds of which in North America and was Fiat - Chrysler 's best selling brand in the U.S. during the first half of 2017 . In the U.S. alone over 2400 dealerships hold franchise rights to sell Jeep - branded vehicles and if Jeep were spun off into a separate company it is estimated to be worth between $22 and $33.5 billion -- slightly more than all of FCA ( US ) . , Jeep 's current product range consists solely of sport utility vehicles and off - road vehicles but has also included pickup trucks in the past .

After Elizabeth is greeted by Hawk outside Meliodas introduces her to a meat pie made with vegetables that looks like Hawk but it turns out to be unfit for human consumption . Meliodas has the idea of using pork as the main ingredient which causes Hawk to make haste out of the bar . Meliodas comes up with a contest for his friends in which he will obey any order for a day from whoever catches Hawk first . However Hawk manages to outsmart them due to his small size . Hawk returns to the Boar Hat and eats food scraps made by Ban who is declared the winner as a result . At night Meliodas takes Elizabeth back to the palace while also assuring that his purpose in life is to protect her . Meliodas then goes to the catacombs to see the Horn of Cernunnos . When the goddess vessel taunts him for his reputation as a demon Meliodas destroys the Horn of Cernunnos in retaliation . `` Our Fighting Festival '' `` Futari no Ken'ka Matsuri '' ( 二 人 の 喧嘩 祭り ) September 4 2016 Ban walks up to a mountaintop to finally settle matters with Meliodas but the former is surprised to see Elizabeth and Hawk as well as the other members of the Seven Deadly Sins and the Holy Knights as part of an audience . Merlin casts a gigantic cubic barrier around Meliodas and Ban in order for the spectators to safely watch the fight . Meanwhile King and Hauser have their own fight to win the attention of Diane .

The construction workers there apologize to her and thank her for saving the kingdom . When King comes to see Diane the two decide to play a game of tag across town . Outside a church a wedding ceremony is interrupted by a demon in which Diane and King combine their skills in defeating the demon . King asks Diane if she regained her memories and she answers him with a kiss on his cheek .

Meanwhile Gilthunder Hauser and Griamore are each hit with falling debris in the streets unaware of the situation . Gowther is distracted by a boy named Pelliot who asks him to retrieve a fat cat off a roof . Since Gowther reminds Pelliot of his mother who recently passed away Gowther transforms into Pelliot 's mother for a moment and disappears when Pelliot 's father finds Pelliot . Meliodas finds Gilthunder Hauser and Griamore at a restaurant where he purposely spills coffee to expose Vivian revealed as the stalker . Merlin punishes Vivian by planting a cursed ring on her finger which will bring pain to her each time the curse is activated and Merlin explains that the Ten Commandments are the highest class in the demon race . At the Boar Hat Merlin quits her job as a waitress while Hawk and Gowther fill in for the position much to the guys ' dismay . ,https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=List_of_The_Seven_Deadly_Sins_episodes&amp;oldid=822182845

BATNA is the key focus and the driving force behind a successful negotiator . A party should generally not accept a worse resolution than its BATNA . Care should be taken however to ensure that deals are accurately valued taking into account all considerations such as relationship value time value of money and the likelihood that the other party will live up to their side of the bargain . These other considerations are often difficult to value since they are frequently based on uncertain or qualitative considerations rather than easily measurable and quantifiable factors . ,https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Best_alternative_to_a_negotiated_agreement&amp;oldid=819966880

Scientists discovered the dynamics of human fertilization in the nineteenth century . , The process of fertilization involves a sperm fusing with an ovum . The most common sequence begins with ejaculation during copulation follows with ovulation and finishes with fertilization . Various exceptions to this sequence are possible including artificial insemination in vitro fertilization external ejaculation without copulation or copulation shortly after ovulation . Upon encountering the secondary oocyte the acrosome of the sperm produces enzymes which allow it to burrow through the outer jelly coat of the egg . The sperm plasma then fuses with the egg 's plasma membrane the sperm head disconnects from its flagellum and the egg travels down the Fallopian tube to reach the uterus . ,https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Human_fertilization&amp;oldid=816596335

By the end of June all of Camagüey was at war . Based on new research in Cuban sources historian John Lawrence Tone demonstrated that Gomez and Maceo were the first to force the civilian forces to choose sides . `` Either they relocated to the east side of the islands where the Cubans controlled the mountainous terrain or they would be accused of supporting the Spanish and be subject to immediate trial and execution . '' Continuing west they were joined by 1868 war veterans such as Polish internationalist General Carlos Roloff and Serafín Sánchez in Las Villas who brought weapons men and experience to the revolutionaries ' arsenal . , During the years 1869 -- 1888 of the so - called `` Rewarding Truce '' lasting for 17 years from the end of the Ten Years ' War in 1878 there were fundamental social changes in Cuban society . With the abolition of slavery in October 1886 freedmen joined the ranks of farmers and the urban working class . The economy could no longer sustain itself with the shift and changes ; therefore many wealthy Cubans lost their property and joined the urban middle class . The number of sugar mills dropped and efficiency increased : only companies and the most powerful plantation owners remained in business followed by the Central Board of Artisans in 1879 and many more across the island . After his second deportation to Spain in 1878 José Martí moved to the United States in 1881 . There he mobilized the support of the Cuban exile community especially in Ybor City ( Tampa area ) and Key West Florida . His goal was revolution in order to achieve independence from Spain . Martí lobbied against the U.S. annexation of Cuba which was desired by some politicians in both the U.S. and Cuba . ,NONE,https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Cuban_War_of_Independence&amp;oldid=832765040
when was the first documented case of tool mark identification,NONE,NONE, The ability to compare ammunition is a direct result of the invention of rifling around the turn of the 16th century . By forcing the bullet to spin as it travels down the barrel of the weapon the bullet 's accuracy greatly increases . At the same time the rifling leaves marks on the bullet that are indicative of that particular barrel . Prior to mass production of firearms each barrel and bullet mold was hand made by gunsmiths making them unique . The first successful documented case of forensic firearm examination occurred in 1835 when a member of the Bow Street Runners in London matched a recovered bullet from a murder victim to a specific mold in a suspect 's home confirming that he made the bullet . Further evidence that the bullet maker was the perpetrator was found in his home and he was convicted . As manufacturing and automation replaced hand tools the ability to compare bullets became impossible due to the standardization of molds within a specific company . However experts in the field postulated that there were microscopic differences on each barrel left during the manufacturing process . These differences were a result of wear on the machines and since each new weapon caused a tiny amount of wear each barrel would be slightly different from every other barrel produced by that company . Also each bullet fired from a specific barrel would be printed with the same marks allowing investigators to identify the weapon that fired a specific bullet . ,NONE,NONE,https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Forensic_firearm_examination&amp;oldid=835623412

where does the brain get its energy from, Brain tissue consumes a large amount of energy in proportion to its volume so large brains place severe metabolic demands on animals . The need to limit body weight in order for example to fly has apparently led to selection for a reduction of brain size in some species such as bats . Most of the brain 's energy consumption goes into sustaining the electric charge ( membrane potential ) of neurons . Most vertebrate species devote between 2 % and 8 % of basal metabolism to the brain . In primates however the percentage is much higher -- in humans it rises to 20 -- 25 % . The energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time but active regions of the cerebral cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions ; this forms the basis for the functional brain imaging methods PET fMRI and NIRS . The brain typically gets most of its energy from oxygen - dependent metabolism of glucose ( i.e. blood sugar ) but ketones provide a major alternative source together with contributions from medium chain fatty acids ( caprylic and heptanoic acids ) lactate acetate and possibly amino acids . , Brain tissue consumes a large amount of energy in proportion to its volume so large brains place severe metabolic demands on animals .
